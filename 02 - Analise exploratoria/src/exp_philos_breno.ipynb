man seeing picture horse lyre recollect man seeing picture simmias recollect cebes seeing picture simmias recollect simmias cases recollection occasioned things similar also occasioned things

mean stick equal stick stone stone socrates precisely phaedo anything kind something else beyond equal shall say exists indeed shall zeus said simmias definitely know whence acquired knowledge things mentioned seeing sticks stones things equal come think different seem different look also way equal stones sticks sometimes remaining appear one equal another unequal equals ever appeared unequal equality inequality equal things equal therefore think socrates definitely equal things though different equal derived grasped knowledge equality true socrates whether like unlike long sight one thing

considerable deficiency said whenever someone seeing something realizes sees wants like reality falls short like since inferior agree one thinks must prior knowledge says like deficiently well also experience equal objects equal must possess knowledge equal time first saw equal objects realized objects strive like equal deficient surely also agree conception derives seeing touching sense

dispersed end existence prevent soul coming constituted source existing enters human body done departed dying destroyed right simmias said cebes half needed proof proved namely soul existed born proof needed exists less died proof complete proved even simmias cebes said socrates ready combine argument one agreed every living thing must come dead soul exists must comes life birth come nowhere else death dead could avoid existing death since must born speak even proved however think simmias would like discuss argument fully seem childish fear wind would really dissolve scatter soul leaves body

lifeless things yes kinds could let part involving lifeless things go name except kinds diving trivial things like part namely hunting living animals call animal hunting right say animal hunting two types one land hunting hunting things feet divided many types many names aquatic hunting hunts animals swim things swim see fall things wings things living underwater hunting things wings suppose

nonexpert expert something well shall suppose sophist layman completely truly expert layman understand saying kind person name sophist indicates seems need take kind expertise heaven sake recognize one man belongs kind angler sophist clearly appear hunters said kind hunting angler kind sophist divided hunting two parts one land animals one swimming animals went one part animals swim underwater left land part undivided though noted contains many types till point sophist angler go way beginning expertise acquisition seem anyway starting animal hunting though turn away one goes ponds rivers sea hunts animals one goes land different kinds rivers like plentiful meadows wealthy youths take possession things living two main kinds things hunt land tame things wild ones thing hunting tame animals human beings tame animals rate make whichever assumption like either tame animals tame animals humans wild else say humans tame hunted specify whichever prefer say think tame animals say humans fact hunted word etymologically related word sophos taken connote knowledge expertise let say hunting tame animals falls two parts let take piracy enslavement tyranny along everything war let

teaching one two important ones think find quickest way text seems faulty general sense however clear seeing whether ignorance cut middle two parts force teaching two parts one parts ignorance well see looking think see large difficult type ignorance marked others overshadowing knowing thinking know probably causes mistakes make think furthermore kind ignorance called lack learning well call part teaching gets rid part consists teaching crafts think athens call one education greeks theaetetus still think whether education indivisible divisions worth mentioning think think cut somehow one part kind teaching done words rough road part smoother mean two parts one forefathers time honored method scolding gently encouraging used employ especially sons many still use nowadays something wrong admonition would right thing call part people seem argument give lack learning always involuntary someone thinks wise never willing learn anything thinks clever people think though admonition lot work much good right set get rid belief one wisdom another way cross examine someone thinks saying something though saying nothing since opinions vary inconsistently people easily scrutinize collect opinions together discussion put side side show conflict time subjects relation things respects people examined see get angry become calmer toward others lose inflated rigid beliefs way loss pleasanter hear lasting effect doctors work body think ca benefit food offered interfering inside removed people cleanse soul young friend likewise think soul wo get advantage learning offered someone shames refuting removes opinions interfere learning exhibits cleansed believing knows things know nothing best healthy minded way reasons theaetetus say refutation principal important kind cleansing

sir well could someone know subject make sound objection someone knew sophist capacity sophists ever make young people believe wiser everyone else everything obvious make correct objections anyone appear young people appear make correct objections controversies make look wiser say people would hardly willing pay money become students people willing since sophists seem think know things dispute

must seek means get share see socrates said great difficulty one marks things forms assure said yet may put inkling great difficulty going posit one form case every time make distinction among things many reasons parmenides said main one suppose someone say forms claim must even known anyone raise objection would able show wrong unless objector happened widely experienced ungifted consented pay

meal according aristodemus dinner poured libation god sang hymn short followed whole ritual turned attention drinking point pausanias addressed group gentlemen arrange drink less tonight honest still terrible hangover yesterday could really use break daresay could since also part celebration let try overdo aristophanes replied good idea pausanias got make plan going easy drink tonight head last night like others spoke eryximachus son acumenus said still one question feel agathon strong enough serious drinking dionysus god wine drunkenness absolutely replied agathon strength left anything lucky stroke us eryximachus said aristodemus phaedrus rest large capacity drinkers already exhausted imagine weak drinkers like feel last night course include socrates claims drink satisfied whatever since none us seems particularly eager overindulge perhaps would amiss provide accurate information nature intoxication learned anything medicine following point inebriation harmful everyone personally therefore always refrain heavy drinking advise others especially people suffering effects previous night excesses well phaedrus interrupted always follow advice especially speak doctor case others know good say point agreed get drunk evening decided drink much pleased settled said eryximachus resolved force one drink wants would like make motion let us dispense flute girl made entrance let play prefers women house let us instead spend evening conversation minded would like propose subject said quite willing urged make proposal eryximachus said begin citing euripides melanippe mine tale tell belongs phaedrus deeply indignant issue often complains says awful thing poets composed hymns honor god think single one given one moment thought god love ancient powerful fancy intellectuals written volumes praising heracles heroes distinguished prodicus well perhaps surprising actually read book accomplished author saw fit extol usefulness salt could people pay attention trifles never even write proper hymn love could anyone ignore great god phaedrus judgment quite right would like therefore take contribution behalf gratify wish besides think splendid time us honor god agree spend whole evening discussion propose us give good speech praise love capable giving proper order left right let us begin phaedrus head table addition father subject one vote eryximachus said socrates could vote thing say understand art love could agathon pausanias could aristophanes thinks nothing dionysus aphrodite one see could vote proposal though quite fair us speak last first speeches turn good enough exhaust subject promise wo complain let phaedrus begin blessing fortune let hear praise love agreed socrates pressed phaedrus start course aristodemus could remember exactly everyone said remember everything told tell remembered best consider important points say said phaedrus spoke first beginning less like love great god wonderful many ways gods men marvelous way came honor one ancient gods proof great age parents love place poetry legend according hesiod first born chaos came earth broad chested seat forever safe love acusilaus agrees hesiod chaos came earth love two parmenides tells beginning first god designed love sides agree love one ancient gods gives us greatest goods say greater good young boy gentle lover lover boy love certain guidance person needs whole life live well nothing imparts guidance high kinship public honor wealth nothing imparts guidance well love guidance mean mean sense shame acting shamefully sense pride acting well without nothing fine great accomplished public private say man love found something shameful accepting shameful treatment coward makes defense nothing would give pain seen boy loves even seen father comrades acusilaus early fifth century writer genealogies parmenides diels kranz thing also boy loves especially ashamed lover caught something shameful way start city army made lovers boys love would best possible system society would hold back shameful seek honor eyes even battle side side would conquer world say man love would never allow loved one people see leaving ranks dropping weapons rather die thousand deaths leaving boy behind coming aid danger one base true love could inspire courage make brave born hero homer says god might heroes really love gift every lover besides one die lover lover even woman alcestis proof everyone greece say true willing die place husband although father mother still alive love went far beyond parents family feeling made look like outsiders belonged son name deed struck everyone even gods nobly done gods delighted fact gave prize reserve handful chosen throngs noble heroes sent soul back dead see eager courage love wins highest honors gods orpheus however sent unsatisfied hades showing image woman came give woman thought soft cithara player dare die like alcestis love sake contrived enter living hades punished made die hands women honor gave achilles another matter sent isles blest dared stand lover patroclus avenge even learned mother would die killed hector chose otherwise go home end life old man instead chose die patroclus man whose life already gods highly delighted course gave special honor made much lover aeschylus talks nonsense claims accepting deletion alcestis self sacrificing wife admetus apollo gave chance live anyone would go hades place orpheus musician legendary powers charmed way underworld search dead wife eurydice achilles lover beautiful patroclus beautiful heroes still beardless besides much younger homer says truth gods honor virtue highly belongs love impressed delighted however generous loved one cherishes lover lover cherishes boy loves lover godlike boy see since inspired god gave higher honor achilles alcestis sent isles blest therefore say love ancient gods honored powerful helping men gain virtue blessedness whether alive passed away less phaedrus said according aristodemus followed several speeches could remember well skipped went directly speech pausanias phaedrus pausanias began quite sure subject well defined charge simple speak praise love would fine love simple matter fact two kinds love view might better begin making clear kind love praise let therefore try put discussion back right track explain kind love ought praised shall give praise deserves god well known fact love aphrodite inseparable therefore aphrodite single goddess could also single love since actually two goddesses name also two kinds love expect disagree two goddesses one older deity motherless daughter uranus god heaven known urania heavenly aphrodite goddess younger daughter zeus dione name pandemos common aphrodite follows therefore common well heavenly love depending goddess love partner although course gods must praised must still make effort keep two gods apart reason applies way every type action considered action either good bad honorable shameful take example case choice drinking singing conversation none better comes depends entirely performed done honorably properly turns honorable done improperly disgraceful point exactly principle applies love love noble worthy play myrmidons homer hint sexual attachment achilles patroclus depends whether sentiments produces us noble common aphrodite love truly common strikes wherever gets chance course love felt vulgar attached women less boys body soul least intelligent partners since care completing sexual act whether honorably concern whatever comes way sometimes good sometimes bad one incidental purpose love moves belongs much younger goddess parentage partakes nature female male contrast love heavenly aphrodite goddess whose descent purely male hence love boys considerably older therefore free lewdness youth inspired love attracted male find pleasure nature stronger intelligent even within group attracted handsome boys moved purely heavenly love fall love little boys prefer older ones whose cheeks showing first traces beard sign begun form minds convinced man falls love young man age generally prepared share everything one loves eager fact spend rest life certainly aim deceive take advantage still young inexperienced exposing ridicule move quickly someone else matter fact law forbidding affairs young boys nothing else time effort would wasted uncertain pursuit uncertain whether particular boy eventually make something physically mentally good men course willing make law like lovers vulgar ones need external restraint reason placed every possible legal obstacle seducing wives daughters vulgar lovers people given love bad reputation gone far claim taking man lover disgraceful would anyone make claim thinking hasty vulgar lovers therefore unfair loved ones nothing done properly accordance customs would ever provoked righteous disapproval point however although customs regarding love cities simple easy understand athens sparta well remarkably complex places people inarticulate like elis boeotia tradition straightforwardly approves taking lover every case one young old would ever consider shameful reason suspect poor speakers want save trouble offer reasons arguments support suits contrast places like ionia almost every part persian empire taking lover always considered disgraceful persian empire absolute condemns love well philosophy sport good rulers people rule cherish ambitions form strong bonds friendship one another precisely effects philosophy sport especially love lesson tyrants athens learned directly experience reign come dismal end bonds uniting harmodius aristogiton love affection see plain condemnation love reveals lust power rulers cowardice ruled indiscriminate approval testifies general dullness stupidity customs already said much difficult understand also far superior recall example consider honorable declare love rather keep secret especially love youth good family accomplishment even beautiful recall also lover encouraged every possible way means considered shameful contrary conquest deemed noble failure shameful attempts conquest custom praise lovers totally extraordinary acts extraordinary fact performed purpose whatever would reap profound contempt suppose example order secure money public post practical benefit another person man willing lovers ones love imagine pressing suit went knees public view begged humiliating way swore sorts vows spent night man doorstep anxious provide services even slave would refused well sure everyone enemies less friends would stand way enemies would jeer fawning servility friends ashamed behalf would try everything bring back senses let lover act ways everyone immediately say charming man blame attaches behavior custom treats noble even remarkable least according popular wisdom gods forgive lover even breaking vows lover vow people say vow freedom given lover gods men according custom immense view might well conclude city consider lover desire willingness satisfy noblest things harmodius aristogiton attempted overthrow tyrant hippias although attempt failed tyranny fell three years later lovers celebrated tyrannicides hand recall fathers hire attendants sons soon old enough attractive attendant main task prevent contact charge suitors recall mercilessly boy friends tease catch strongly elders approve even encourage mocking take account bound come conclusion athenians consider behavior shameful thing world opinion however fact matter said earlier love like everything else complex considered simply neither honorable disgrace character depends entirely behavior gives rise give oneself vile man vile way truly disgraceful behavior contrast perfectly honorable give oneself honorably right man may want know counts vile context tell common vulgar lover loves body rather soul man whose love bound inconstant since loves mutable unstable moment body longer bloom flies away promises vows tatters behind different man loves right sort character remains lover life attached something permanent see point customs designed separate wheat chaff proper love vile everything make easy possible lovers press suits difficult possible young men comply like competition kind test determine sort belongs explains two facts first consider shameful yield quickly passage time provides good test matters second also consider shameful man seduced money political power either cringes ill treatment endure tasted benefits wealth power rise none benefits stable permanent apart fact genuine affection possibly based upon customs provide one honorable way taking man lover addition recognizing lover total willing subjugation beloved wishes neither servile reprehensible allow one one reason willingly subjecting oneself another equally reproach subjection sake virtue someone decides put another disposal thinks make better wisdom part virtue approve voluntary subjection consider neither shameful servile principles principle governing proper attitude toward lover young men principle governing love wisdom virtue general must combined young man accept lover honorable way older lover young man come together obeys principle appropriate lover realizes justified anything loved one grants favors young man understands justified performing service lover make wise virtuous lover able help young man become wiser better young man eager taught improved lover two principles coincide absolutely ever honorable young man accept lover case notice never shameful deceived every case shameful deceiver person deceives suppose example someone thinks lover rich accepts money action wo less shameful turns deceived lover poor man young man already shown sort person anything money far honorable token suppose someone takes lover mistaken belief lover good man likely make better reality man horrible totally lacking virtue even noble deceived demonstrated something sort person anything sake virtue could honorable follows therefore giving lover virtue sake honorable whatever outcome course heavenly love heavenly goddess love value city whole citizens immeasurable compels lover loved one alike make virtue central concern forms love belong

magnificently expounded qualities ways tell love love love something nothing asking born mother father question whether love love mother father would really ridiculous asking father whether father father something tell course wanted give good answer son daughter father father certainly said agathon go mother agreed also well said socrates little fully understand better want ask brother insofar brother brother something said brother sister try tell love said love love nothing something something surely keep object love mind remember tell much love desire love time desires loves something actually desires loves time least would likely said instead likely said socrates whether necessary thing desires desires something need otherwise need would desire ca tell agathon strongly strikes necessary think would someone tall want tall someone strong want strong impossible basis agreed presumably one need things already maybe strong man could want strong said socrates fast one fast healthy one healthy cases like might think people really want things already want qualities already bring wo deceive us cases agathon stop think see people present time whether want logical necessity may ask would ever bother desire necessary event someone says healthy want rich want desire things let us say already riches health strength possession man want possess things time come since present whether want whenever say desire already ask whether mean want things mine future well according aristodemus agathon said would socrates said love something hand lover desire preservation time come quite said man anyone else desire desires hand present need objects desire love said socrates let us review points agreed first love love something second loves things present need remember addition

skill say judicial skill justice dare say never objected believe ever object arguments many eloquent ones like effect virtue teachable care devoted one self anything else consider extremely beneficial extremely clitophon effective turning us right direction really rouse us sleeping therefore interested would come next arguments first asked socrates companions fellow enthusiasts friends whatever

argumentative person scorns ordinary pleasures aspires things always especially attracted people socrates gone piraeus first place adeimantus equally decent young man less driven less demanding easily satisfied less gifted philosophical argument book socrates carries discussion first one two men conversation whole aims answering satisfaction challenge jointly raise socrates conviction justice preeminent good person socrates addresses different parts reply different one assist reader inserted names speakers tops pages translation though books socrates longer searches truth criticizing interlocutors ideas proceeds nonetheless spirit exploration discovery proposing bold hypotheses seeking confirmation first instance examining consequences often emphasizes tentativeness results need extensive treatment quite different main speaker late dialogues philebus whether socrates visitor elea athens get confident reasoned delivery philosophical results assumed speaker well established went piraeus yesterday glaucon son ariston wanted say prayer goddess also curious see would manage festival since holding first time thought procession local residents fine one one conducted thracians less outstanding said prayer seen procession started back towards athens polemarchus saw us distance setting home told slave run ask us wait slave caught hold cloak behind polemarchus wants wait said turned around asked polemarchus coming behind said please wait glaucon replied right polemarchus caught us adeimantus glaucon brother niceratus son nicias others apparently way procession polemarchus said looks socrates two starting athens looks way said see many thracian goddess bendis whose cult recently introduced piraeus harbor town athens well must either prove stronger stay another alternative namely persuade let us go could persuade us wo listen certainly glaucon said well wo listen better make mind know adeimantus said torch race horseback goddess tonight something new going race horseback hand torches relays relays polemarchus said night festival well worth seeing dinner go look joined many young men talk seems glaucon said stay think said must went polemarchus house found lysias euthydemus brothers polemarchus thrasymachus chalcedon charmantides paeania clitophon son aristonymus polemarchus father cephalus also thought looked quite old seen time sitting sort cushioned chair wreath head offering sacrifice courtyard circle chairs sat soon saw cephalus welcomed said socrates come piraeus see us often still easy walk town would come come ought come often know physical pleasures wither away desire conversation pleasures grows stay young men come regularly see us would friends relatives indeed cephalus replied enjoy talking old ask might ask travelled road probably follow kind road whether rough difficult smooth easy gladly find think reached point life poets call threshold old age difficult time report god socrates tell exactly think number us less age often get together accordance old saying meet majority complain lost pleasures god ever draws together like like odyssey xvii remember youth sex drinking parties feasts things go along get angry deprived important things lived well hardly living others moan abuse heaped old people relatives repeat old age cause many evils think blame real cause socrates old age really cause suffered way everyone else age met feel like least indeed present someone asked poet sophocles far sex goes sophocles still make love woman poet replied glad escaped like slave escaped savage tyrannical master thought time right still old age brings peace freedom things appetites relax cease importune us everything sophocles said comes pass escape many mad masters matters concerning relatives real cause old age socrates way people live moderate contented old age moderately onerous old age youth hard bear admired saying wanted tell urged say things like cephalus suppose majority people agree think bear old age easily way live wealthy wealthy say many consolations true agree something say though much think themistocles retort relevant someone seriphus insulted saying high reputation due city replied seriphian would famous neither would even athenian applies rich find old age hard bear good person would easily bear old age poor bad one would peace even wealthy inherit wealth cephalus asked make make socrates ask money maker sort mean grandfather father grandfather namesake inherited amount wealth possess multiplied many times father lysanias however diminished amount even less satisfied leave sons less little inherited reason asked seem love money much made money usually like made twice fond poets love poems fathers love children made money care useful people something made makes poor company good word say anything except money tell something else greatest good received wealthy say probably would persuade people know socrates someone thinks end near becomes frightened concerned things fear stories told hades people unjust must pay penalty stories used make fun twist soul way fear true whether weakness old age closer happens hades clearer view whatever filled foreboding fear examines see whether unjust anyone finds many injustices life awakes sleep terror children lives anticipation bad things come someone knows unjust sweet good hope constant companion nurse old age pind says puts charmingly socrates says someone lives pious life sweet hope heart nurse companion age hope captain ever twisting minds mortal men wonderfully well puts connection wealth valuable say every man decent orderly one wealth lot save us cheat deceive someone depart place fear owe sacrifice god money person many uses benefit benefit say useful man understanding fine sentiment cephalus speaking thing namely justice say unconditionally speaking truth paying whatever debts one incurred things sometimes sometimes unjust mean sort thing example everyone would surely agree sane man lends weapons friend asks back mind friend return would acting justly anyone willing tell whole truth someone mind  definition justice speaking truth repaying one borrowed certainly socrates said polemarchus interrupting indeed trust simonides well cephalus said hand argument look sacrifice polemarchus said heir everything certainly cephalus said laughing went sacrifice tell us heir argument said simonides stated justice consider correct stated give owed fine saying view well easy doubt simonides wise godlike man exactly mean perhaps know polemarchus understand clearly mean said moment ago give back whatever person lent even mind asks yet lent surely something owed absolutely given mind seems simonides must meant something different says return owed something different indeed god means friends owe friends good never harm someone give lender back owed giving gold would harmful lender friends think simonides meant one also give one enemies whatever owed means one give owed view enemies owe appropriately precisely something bad seems simonides speaking riddles like poet said justice thought give appropriate called giving owed else think meant think answer someone asked things owed appropriate someone simonides lyric elegiac poet born aegean island something craft call medicine give give clear gives medicines food drink bodies owed appropriate things craft call cooking give give gives seasonings food craft call justice give give follow previous answers socrates gives benefits friends harm enemies simonides means treat friends well enemies badly justice

according argument rate person turned seems kind thief maybe learned homer fond autolycus maternal grandfather odysseus describes better everyone lying stealing according homer simonides justice seems sort craft stealing one benefits friends harms enemies meant god know mean still believe benefit one friends harm one enemies justice speaking friends mean person believes good useful actually good useful even think similarly enemies probably one loves one considers good useful hates one considers bad harmful surely people often make mistakes believing many people good useful making opposite mistake enemies good people enemies bad ones friends benefit bad people harm good ones good people able wrong according account bad things injustice socrates account must bad one harm unjust people benefit ones obviously attractive view one anyway follows polemarchus many mistaken judgment harm friends bad benefit enemies good arrive conclusion opposite said simonides meant certainly follows let change definition seems define friends enemies correctly define polemarchus said friend someone believed useful change someone believed useful useful friend someone believed useful believed friend enemy  according account good person friend bad one enemy want us add something said justice said treat friends well enemies badly want us add treat well friend good harm enemy bad role man harm

searching justice thing valuable even large quantity gold mindlessly give way one another less completely serious finding surely must think rather incapable finding hence surely far appropriate us pitied clever people given rough treatment heard gave loud sarcastic laugh heracles said socrates usual irony knew said people earlier unwilling answer someone questioned ironical anything rather give

also advantageous us weaker disgust socrates trick take hold argument point harm tell us clearly mean know cities ruled tyranny democracy aristocracy city element stronger namely ruler makes laws advantage democracy makes democratic laws tyranny makes tyrannical laws others declare made advantage subjects punish anyone goes lawless unjust say justice cities advantage established rule since

incorrect prescribes disadvantage whatever laws make must obeyed subjects justice according account advantage stronger also opposite advantage let examine fully agreed giving orders subjects rulers sometimes error best yet subjects whatever rulers order agreed much must also think agreed disadvantageous rulers stronger whenever unintentionally order bad also say others obey orders give terribly clever thrasymachus necessarily follow opposite said since weaker ordered disadvantageous stronger god socrates said polemarchus quite clear witness anyway said clitophon interrupting needs witness polemarchus replied thrasymachus agrees rulers sometimes order bad others polemarchus thrasymachus maintained obey orders rulers also maintained clitophon advantage stronger maintained principles went agree stronger sometimes gives orders weaker words subjects disadvantageous stronger agreements follows advantage stronger advantage clitophon responded said advantage stronger stronger believes advantage weaker must maintained said polemarchus replied makes difference polemarchus said thrasymachus wants put way let accept tell thrasymachus wanted say namely stronger believes advantage whether fact advantage say mean think call someone error stronger moment errs think meant agreed rulers infallible liable error false witness arguments socrates someone makes error treatment patients
